 ====major release, this is close to being a total rewrite====

 _HIGHLIGHTS_
  * support for minor player detection (switched to swfObject's detection code)
  * easier express install
  * removed the old useless actions. You can now only write the embed tag inside a dynamically created div, redirect to a URL or use express install. For anything else, just use the `swfIN.detect.isPlayerVersionValid()` method in a conditional statement.
  * new alert warnings to make sure devs don't make distraction mistakes
  * SEO support with the `.hideSEO()` method
  * event handling instead of the old destructive `window.resize = refresh`
  * moved development environment to Aptana
  * Much better naming scheme and hints to static/dynamic/public/private methods and vars
  * everything is now under the swfIN namespace, so conflicts are less than likely to happen
  * this release also marks a stop to the Netscape 4 support (let's stop the insanity)
  * ... and much more. Docs coming soon to cover everything.
